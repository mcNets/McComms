# McComms.Sockets

Socket-based implementation for the McComms solution. This package provides TCP/IP socket-based implementations of the ICommsClient and ICommsServer interfaces from McComms.Core.

## TCP/IP Socket Communication Model

This implementation uses plain TCP/IP sockets with a simple text-based protocol for communication.

## Benefits of Socket-based Implementation

- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to higher-level protocols
- **Reliable**: Built on established TCP/IP technology
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports standard sockets
- **Direct Control**: Fine-grained control over connection handling
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for performance with minimal protocol overhead

## Information and basic usage

Have a look at the readme of [McComms project](https://github.com/mcnets/McComms) for more information and basic usage examples.
